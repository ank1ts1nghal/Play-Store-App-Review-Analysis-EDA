#**Play Store App Review Analysis**

Over the years, Google Play Store has evolved into a one-stop platform for downloading apps from different categories. It is the central hub for millions of apps for your smartphone. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Play Store App by comparing over ten thousand apps and reviews across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

The data used for this project consists of two files:


*   Play Store Data.csv : This dataset contains all the details of the applications on Google Play Store. There are 13 features for each app.
*   User Reviews.csv : It contains reviews for each app along with Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
